# Entry Fee
League fees will be $50 for the 2025-2026 season with the intention of increasing next year. This season, all competing teams must buy in before the chosen initial draft, any team not bought in will be removed from the league. Future years fees will be non-refundable in the interest of competition.

___

# Teams
The intention is to have 12 franchises, but as each year may be variable the structure will change. Franchises competing this season:
- New England Flaccid Balls(Tanner Ottinger)

___

# Roster
Each team will have a maximum of 16 active players. Teams shall have no more than 3 quarterbacks, but there will be no other restrictions. 2 IR slots will be available, but managers will be required to monitor their players status and activate when necessary within a timely fashion to ensure the IR slots aren't used as extra active player storage.

___

# Starting Lineup
Players will be locked at their respective game times. Each week managers shall start the following:
- 1 QB
- 2 RBs
- 2 WRs
- 1 TE
- 2 FLEXs

*I've decided to force managers to start and keep a full roster, to prevent a team that's ahead from benching their remaining players. I've seen debates about this and understand both sides but I think this will help both avoid drama and make games more competitive - let me know your thoughts if you disagree.*

___

# Scoring
See scoring settings within Sleeper.

___

# Schedule & Divisions
Franchises will be split into two conferences with two divisions, which will be filled randomly with 3 teams each(franchise count allowing). Each franchise will play 13 regular season games as follows:

| # of games | Opponent                                                               | Total Games |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 2          | Each divisional opponent                                               | 6           |
| 1          | Rival Game(randomly picked if no rival exists)                         | 1           |
| 1          | Each remaining conference opponent                                     | 3           |
| 1          | Against 3 out-of-conference opponents(Based on end of season rankings) | 3           |
| -          | -                                                                      | 13          |

___

# Playoffs
I've decided on a 6 team playoff that will be better suited for more franchises joining. 
- Both conference leaders will occupy seeds 1 and 2, seeded based on conference record then [[#Standard Ranking Tiebreaker]].
- Both remaining division leaders will occupy seeds 3 and 4, seeded based on conference record then [[#Standard Ranking Tiebreaker]].
- Seed 5 and 6 will be occupied by the two at-large teams for each conference, seeded based on *overall* record then [[#Standard Ranking Tiebreaker]].

Conference leaders will be awarded a bye week. The first week of playoffs(Week 14) will be as follows:

| Home                                     | vs. | Away                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | --- | --------------------------- |
| #1(Higher conference champ)              |     | Bye                         |
| #2(Lower conference champ)               |     | Bye                         |
| #3(Highest ranked non-div-champ)         |     | #6(lowest ranked at-large)  |
| #4(Second highest ranked non-div-champ)  |     | #5(highest ranked at-large) |

The second week(week 15) of playoffs:

| Home    | vs. | Away                |
| ------- | --- | ------------------- |
| #1 seed |     | Winner of #4 vs. #5 |
| #2 seed |     | Winner of #3 vs. #6 |

The championship will be played in week 16 with the two remaining teams.

*Will likely be a standard 4-team bracket if fewer than 12 franchises participates.*

___

# Losers Bracket

Losers bracket will be a standard bracket, with the final winner getting the following 1.02 draft pick.

___

# Toilet Bowl
The Toilet Bowl will consist of the bottom two franchises of the league based on the [[#Standard Ranking Tiebreaker]]. These franchises will compete in a best of three playoff in weeks 14-16. The winner receives the 1.01 pick in the following draft, and the loser gets the 1.03 pick.

___

# Standard Ranking Tiebreaker
Ranking ties shall be decided based on the following, in order:
- Overall Win/Loss record
- Head-to-Head record
- Divisional Win/Loss record
- Conference Win/Loss record
- Total Points For.

___

# Waivers
Blind bidding waivers will run year-round with separate in-season and off-season Free Agent Acquisition Budget(FAAB). From the start of preseason, to the first Wednesday after the Super Bowl(note: not the fantasy championship), each franchise will have $1000 total FAAB to spend bidding on players in the waiver wire.

In-season waivers will run Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 11:00am *EST*.

During the off-season(Beginning the first Wednesday after the SB), all franchises will be reset to $200 of FAAB and waivers will only process once a week on Wednesdays at 11:00am *EST*.

In the event that two franchises submit an equal bid on a free agent, the team which submitted their bid first will win the tie. 

___

# Trades
Managers may trade players or draft picks at any time of year except during playoffs. Trading is blocked starting Wednesday at 11:00am *EST* before week 14 up until Tuesday at 11:00am *EST* after the conclusion of week 16.

Trades will process immediately upon acceptance. Except in the case of collusion, all trades are final, no takebacksies. Players outplaying or underplaying projections is not a valid reason to undo a trade, nor is being finessed. 

If trading collusion is suspected, please report it to the commissioner. The commissioner will investigate trades and apply actions as necessary. 

Trades involving future draft picks shall not be permitted unless the dues for the seasons in question have been paid in advance by both franchises.

If a trade was offered or accepted in error, the manager making the error must notify the commissioner and the manager of the other team immediately (i.e. within 5 minutes of the trade's acceptance) to request that the trade be voided. Trades will only be revoked because of legitimate manager error that is reported in a timely manner; managers may not request that a trade be voided due to buyer’s remorse, seller’s remorse or failure to perform due diligence before proposing or accepting a trade. The Commissioner reserves the right to allow a trade to stand if a manager's claim of error is not deemed to be credible.

___

# Payouts
The final structure is subject to change based on participants. Basically 3&4 get their fee back, 2 gets double their fee and the champ gets $400.

| Final Standing | Payout |
