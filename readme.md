___

# Entry Fee
The entry fee for the 2025-2026 season will be **$50**, increasing to $100 beginning for the 2026-2027 season. All competing teams must pay their entry fee in full prior to the scheduled startup draft, and annual rookie drafts in the future. Any team that fails to pay by this deadline will be removed from the league and replaced with a new owner.

In this league, all entry fees are non-refundable. To trade future draft picks, both teams involved in the trade must prepay the entry fees for the season in question. This policy ensures that all managers remain committed to the league and prevents disruptions caused by unpaid dues.

___

# Roster

Each team will have a maximum of 25 active players. Teams are allowed no more than three quarterbacks, but there are no restrictions on other positions. Four injured reserve (IR) slots will be available for use, and managers are responsible for monitoring player statuses. Players must be activated from the IR slots within two weeks once they are no longer tagged IR, to prevent these slots from being used as extra active player storage. 

To accommodate the rookie draft, teams will receive four additional roster slots during the offseason immediately before the rookie draft. These slots will increase the roster size temporarily, but rosters must be trimmed back to the 25-player limit by the Wednesday before Week 1 of the NFL regular season.

___

# Starting Lineup
Players will lock at the start of their respective game times each week. Managers are required to set a starting lineup consisting of the following positions:

- 1 Quarterback
- 2 Running Backs
- 2 Wide Receivers
- 1 Tight End
- 2 Flex positions
- 1 Super Flex position

The Flex positions can include any combination of RBs, WRs, or TEs, while the Super Flex position may additionally include a QB. This league will not including kickers or Special Teams/Team Defense.

Managers are required to play a full lineup each week. Benching players to ensure a win is not allowed.

___

___

# Schedule And Divisions
Franchises will be divided into two conferences, each containing two divisions. Divisions will be filled randomly, with three teams per division, assuming the franchise count allows.

## Conferences and Divisions

- **North Conference**
    - Northeast Division
    - Northwest Division
- **South Conference**
    - Southeast Division
    - Southwest Division

## Regular Season Schedule

Each franchise will play a total of 14 regular season games. The schedule is structured as follows:

| # of games | Opponent                                              | Total Games |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 2          | Each divisional opponent                              | 6           |
| 2          | Random out-of-conference opponents(random every year) | 2           |
| 1          | Each remaining conference opponent                    | 3           |
| 1          | Against 3 random out of conference opponents          | 3           |
| -          | -                                                     | 14          |

	Anytime something is to be "random" the Commissioner will use an online tool to draw random teams. 

___

# Playoffs
The league will feature a 6-team playoff format, designed to accommodate potential future expansion. This structure ensures competitiveness while providing opportunities for top-performing teams across both conferences.

## Playoff Seeding
- **Conference Champions:** The better division leader in each conference will be crowned the conference champion. Conference champions will receive the #1 and #2 seeds, with their order determined by overall record, conference record, then total Points For (PF).
- **Division Champions:** The lesser division leader in each conference will be awarded the division champion spot. These teams will receive the #3 and #4 seeds, ranked by overall record, conference record, and total Points For (PF).
- **At-Large Bids:** Each conference will award one at-large playoff spot to the best remaining team. At-large teams will be determined by *overall record*, conference record, and total Points For (PF).

| Seed | Team                                     |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Higher ranked conference champ           |
| 2    | Lower ranked conference champ            |
| 3    | Next highest ranked division champ       |
| 4    | Last ranked division champ               |
| 5    | Next best at-large team for conference A |
| 6    | Next best at-large team for conference B | 


## Playoff Schedule
The top two seeds in the playoffs (conference champions) will receive a bye week in the first round. The schedule is as follows:

**First Week of Playoffs (Week 15):**

| Home | Away |
| ---- | ---- |
| #1   | Bye  |
| #2   | Bye  |
| #3   | #6   |
| #4   | #5   |

**Second Week of Playoffs (Week 16):**

| Home | Away                |
| ---- | ------------------- |
| #1   | Winner of #4 vs. #5 |
| #2   | Winner of #3 vs. #6 |

The wildcard round losers will probably be sitting out the rest of the season, unless the Sleeper app allows for reintroducing them into the consolation bracket.

**Championship (Week 17):**  
The two remaining teams will face off in the championship game. Additionally, the #3 and #4 seeds will play in a runoff game to determine their rookie draft pick positions, with the winner receiving the x.09 pick and the loser receiving the x.10 pick.

___

# Consolation Bracket

The consolation bracket will mimic the playoff bracket, featuring the 7th through 12th seeds. Seeding for the consolation bracket will be determined based on overall record, with total Points For (PF) used as the tiebreaker if necessary. Unlike the playoff bracket, conference or division standings will not factor into the seeding process. The exact format of this bracket will be up to the Sleeper app ultimately.

The consolation bracket exists purely for fun and will not have any impact on the draft order for the following season. It is intended to keep teams engaged while the championship bracket plays out.

___

# Rankings
Rankings will be compiled by the Commissioner and made publicly available each week, starting after Week 1. While overall rankings in the app(I'm not sure how they'll be displayed there yet) provide a useful overview of team performance, they are secondary to division and conference rankings for determining playoff qualification. Playoff spots will be awarded to all division leaders and two at-large teams, based on the following criteria:

### Division Rankings

- Rankings within each division will be determined by **division win/loss record**.
- Ties will be broken in the following order:
    1. Head-to-head record
    2. Total Points For (PF)

### Conference Leaders

- Between the two division leaders in each conference, the conference leader will be determined by **overall win/loss record**.
- Ties will be broken in the following order:
    1. Conference record
    2. Head-to-head record
    3. Total Points For (PF)

### At-Large Spots

- At-large teams will be ranked based on **overall win/loss record**.
- Ties will be broken in the following order:
    1. Conference record
    2. Total Points For (PF)

___

# Waivers

The league will operate with blind bidding waivers, which will run year-round and utilize separate in-season and off-season Free Agent Acquisition Budgets (FAAB). Waivers are designed to ensure all teams have a fair chance to acquire free agents while encouraging strategic management of FAAB resources.

During the **in-season period**, which begins at the start of the preseason and ends on the first Wednesday after the Super Bowl (note: not the fantasy championship), each franchise will have $1,000 in FAAB. This budget can be used to bid on players available on the waiver wire. Waivers will process daily at 11:00 AM *EST*, except on Mondays and Tuesdays.

The **off-season period** begins on the first Wednesday following the Super Bowl. At this point, all franchises’ FAAB budgets will reset to $200. Waivers during the off-season will also process daily at 11:00 AM *EST*, except on Mondays and Tuesdays.

Unused FAAB will not roll over between the in-season and off-season periods. Each period's budget must be used or forfeited when the period ends.

FAAB is fully tradeable during both the in-season and off-season periods, allowing franchises to strategically manage their resources in trades alongside players or draft picks.

In the event that two franchises submit equal bids for the same free agent, Sleeper’s default waiver-wire tie-breaker settings for FAAB will be used to resolve the tie.

___

# Trades

Managers may trade players or draft picks at any time of year, except during the playoffs. Trading will be blocked from **Wednesday at 11:00 AM EST before Week 14** until **Wednesday at 11:00 AM EST following the conclusion of the playoffs**.

Trades will process immediately upon acceptance. Except in cases of proven collusion, all trades are final—no exceptions. Players overperforming or underperforming projections is not a valid reason to undo a trade, nor is regret over being outmaneuvered in negotiations.

If collusion is suspected, managers should report the issue to the Commissioner. The Commissioner will investigate all reported trades and take appropriate action if necessary, ensuring the integrity of the league is maintained.

## Trading Draft Picks

Trades involving future draft picks are permitted under the following conditions:

- Both teams involved must have prepaid their league dues for the seasons in question.
- Draft picks beyond two seasons into the future cannot be traded.

## Errors in Trades

If a trade is offered or accepted in error, the manager responsible must notify both the Commissioner and the other team’s manager immediately. Trades will only be voided if the error is legitimate and reported in a timely manner.

Errors include mistaken selections or miscommunications about trade terms. Trades will not be reversed for buyer’s remorse, seller’s remorse, or failure to perform due diligence. The Commissioner reserves the right to allow a trade to stand if a manager’s claim of error is deemed not credible or lacks sufficient evidence.

___

# Payouts
The payout structure is based on the league’s current number of participants and may be adjusted if the number of teams changes. The following table outlines the default payouts for a 12-team league:

| Final Standing | Payout |
| -------------- | ------ |
| 1              | $400   |
| 2              | $100   |
| 3              | $50    |
| 4              | $50    |
| 5-12           | $0     |
| \-             | $600   |

The total prize pool for the league is $600, distributed as shown above.

### Notes:

- The 3rd and 4th place finishers receive their entry fee back.
- The 2nd place finisher earns double their entry fee.
- The champion receives the largest payout, totaling $400.
- Adjustments to this structure will be made if league size changes.

___

# Startup Draft
### **Date conducted: TBD**

The startup draft will only occur in the league's inaugural season. It will follow a standard snake draft format, with the draft order determined randomly using any reputable online tool. The draft will take place shortly after the NFL Draft, and the player pool will include all eligible players, including rookies.

This draft will be conducted as a **long draft**, allowing owners up to 6 hours to make their selections. The long draft format is designed to accommodate owners in different time zones and with varying schedules, ensuring everyone has an equal opportunity to participate. The draft clock will pause overnight, from 10:00 PM to 8:00 AM EST. During this time, owners may still make their picks, but the timer will not count down. Owners are strongly encouraged to set pre-draft queues to facilitate quicker selections, especially if they already know their preferred picks.

All owners are expected to monitor the draft closely and make their picks as quickly as possible to avoid unnecessary delays. If an owner’s time limit expires during active hours, their pick will be made automatically. The automatic selection will prioritize any players in the owner's queue; if no queue exists, the system will select the highest-ranked available player based on CPU rankings.

___

# Annual Rookie Draft
### **Date conducted: TBD**

A four round rookie draft will occur annually after the conclusion of the NFL Draft. The draft order will be determined by the inverse of the previous seasons final regular season *overall* rankings. These will be ranked by overall record, then total Points For (PF). The winner of #3 vs #4 in the previous season will have the x.09, loser getting x.10. The champion will have the last pick, and the runner up will have the second last.

The rookie draft will be conducted as a **long draft**, similar to the startup draft format. Owners will have up to 6 hours to make their selections, with the draft clock pausing overnight from 10:00 PM to 8:00 AM EST. During this pause, owners may still make their picks, but the timer will not count down. The long draft format ensures that owners in different time zones and with varying schedules can participate equally.

Owners are encouraged to set pre-draft queues to expedite the process, particularly if they have a clear idea of their desired picks. If an owner’s time limit expires during active hours, their selection will be made automatically. Priority will be given to any players in the owner's queue; if no queue exists, the highest-ranked available player based on CPU rankings will be selected.

To accommodate the rookie draft, the league-wide [roster size limit](#roster) will temporarily increase to allow for the addition of up to four draft picks per team. This increase will take effect immediately before the rookie draft begins and will revert to the standard 25-player limit before the start of the regular season. Owners must adjust their rosters to comply with this limit by the designated deadline to avoid penalties.

Owners are responsible for notifying the Commissioner if they aren't able to participate in the rookie draft for any reason. Participation is important here; it can be rescheduled to accommodate. A missed rookie draft without notice is consider an abandoned and will become an [orphan team](#orphan-teams).

## Draft Order Template
The "rankings" here will be determined by the overall record, then total regular season Points For (PF).

| Pick | Seed               |
| ---- | ------------------ |
| x.01 | #12 ranked team    |
| x.02 | #11 ranked team    |
| x.03 | #10 ranked team    |
| x.04 | #9 ranked team     |
| x.05 | #8 ranked team     |
| x.06 | #7 ranked team     |
| x.07 | #6 ranked team     |
| x.08 | #5 ranked team     | 
| x.09 | Winner of #3 vs #4 |
| x.10 | Loser of #3 vs #4  |
| x.11 | Runner up          |
| x.12 | Current champion   |


___

# Rule Changes
The process for rule changes is divided into **In-Season** and **Out-of-Season** categories based on their impact on the competitive balance of the league.

In-Season Rule Changes address unforeseen situations or consequences of existing rules that require immediate attention to maintain fairness across all franchises. These could involve scoring settings adjustments, waiver disputes, or other issues that might unfairly disadvantage a minority of teams. Out-of-Season Rule Changes, on the other hand, involve larger structural adjustments, such as roster size changes or alterations to the playoff format.
## In-Season Rule Changes

In-season rule changes are managed at the discretion of the Commissioner. If you believe an immediate rule change is necessary, contact the Commissioner as soon as possible with a clear explanation of the issue and the proposed resolution. The Commissioner may implement rule changes retroactively or immediately in situations that demand urgent action to ensure fairness.

In most cases, a one-week waiting period may be applied before implementing a rule change to prevent any team from gaining an unfair advantage. This waiting period is not mandatory and will depend on the specific circumstances. The Commissioner may also seek input from the league, ensuring that the solution is in the best interest of all franchises.

## Out-of-Season Rule Changes

Out-of-season rule changes are determined through a league vote, requiring a two-thirds majority for approval. To propose a rule change, a league member must present the idea to the Commissioner, who will organize an official vote. Once a rule change is approved, the Commissioner is responsible for overseeing its implementation. The timeline and specific details for enacting the change will be determined by the Commissioner to align with the league’s goals and structure.

All *reasonable* rule changes are eligible for consideration. Once passed, these changes are enacted with the intent of improving the league’s long-term functionality.

___

# Orphan Teams

Franchise owners may retire from the league in good standing by announcing their retirement before the conclusion of **the playoffs in Week 17**. Upon announcing retirement, a replacement owner will be sought, and the incoming owner will be responsible for the upcoming season’s league fee if it has not already been paid by the retiring owner. Retiring owners are prohibited from making trades for the remainder of the season. Retirement announcements are irrevocable; however, managers retiring in good standing may be considered for reinstatement in the future.

## Circumstances Creating Orphan Teams

In addition to voluntary retirement, orphan teams may also arise under the following conditions:

### Quitting Manager

If an owner publicly declares they are quitting the league, their team is immediately classified as an orphan team. The Commissioner will assume control of the team until a replacement owner is found. Written public declarations of quitting, such as “I quit,” are permanent and irrevocable. Quitting managers are permanently barred from reinstatement to the league.

### Abandoning Manager

A team is considered abandoned under the following conditions:

- **In-Season:** The manager fails to set a valid lineup for **two consecutive games.**
- **Off-Season:** The manager fails to attend the rookie draft without prior notice or valid justification.

Managers unable to participate in the rookie draft must notify the Commissioner in advance so the draft can be rescheduled to accommodate all owners.

### Manager Removal

Managers *may* be removed from the league under certain circumstances, including but not limited to:

- Failure to pay league fees by the annual deadline.
- Cheating or anti-competitive conduct.
- Collusion between teams.
- Offering or accepting bribes (e.g., real-life money or other considerations) to influence trades, transactions, or league activity.
- Conduct or transactions detrimental to the league.
- Repeated violations of league rules or refusal to abide by Commissioner rulings.

The Commissioner will exercise discretion in determining whether removal is necessary, and removal is not guaranteed in any particular situation.

## Managing Orphan Teams

If a team becomes orphaned during the season, the Commissioner will manage the team’s starting lineup for the remainder of the season or appoint another manager to do so until a replacement owner is found.

Orphaned teams are **ineligible** to participate in the Championship playoff bracket. In such cases, the next best alternative team will be selected based on the [Rankings](#rankings).

## Financial Considerations for Orphan Teams

Entry fees from an orphaned team will remain tied to that franchise and will apply to future seasons for the new owner. This ensures continuity and fairness while maintaining the league's financial structure.

___

# Anticompetitive conduct
Anticompetitive conduct is defined as any behavior by an owner that intentionally disrupts or diminishes the natural competition and integrity of the league. Such actions are strictly prohibited. The Commissioner will address violations on a case-by-case basis and may codify further actions or rules as necessary.

### Prohibited Anticompetitive Actions

- **Anticompetitive Trades**:  
    Owners may not engage in trades that intentionally worsen their own team to benefit another team, particularly when the intent is to manipulate the outcome of a matchup involving a third party. While trading players for draft picks is allowed, owners may not trade players if they do not intend to return to the league for the following season. The Commissioner reserves the right to retroactively void a trade if there is clear and convincing evidence that it was conducted on anticompetitive grounds not apparent at the time.
    
- **Collusion**:  
    Collusion occurs when two or more managers coordinate to influence league outcomes, such as game results, draft standings, or player availability. Examples of collusion include, but are not limited to:
    
    - Arranging trades to consolidate stronger players on one team.
    - Agreeing to share payouts or rewards through coordinated actions.
    - Trading a player with the condition that they be traded back.  
        Any unsportsmanlike conduct between managers that undermines league integrity is considered collusion and is prohibited.
- **Dumping**:  
    Managers who cut obviously valuable players without valid strategic reasoning are subject to sanctions by the Commissioner. While dropping borderline players is normal, dumping obvious fantasy starters, large numbers of average players, or engaging in behavior intended to manipulate draft positions, make players unfairly available to others, or sabotage the league’s integrity is not allowed.
    
- **Competitive Indifference**:  
    Managers must submit a valid starting lineup each week and replace inactive players who are injured, benched, suspended, or on their bye week. Failing to do so constitutes competitive indifference and violates league rules.
    

### Reporting Anticompetitive Conduct

League members are encouraged to remain vigilant and report any suspected anticompetitive conduct to the Commissioner as soon as possible. Clear and prompt reporting allows for a timely investigation and resolution. When reporting, managers should provide as much detail and evidence as possible (e.g., screenshots, trade logs, or messages) to assist the Commissioner in determining whether a violation has occurred.

Maintaining the integrity of the league is a shared responsibility, and active participation in identifying and addressing violations ensures a competitive and fair environment for all.
