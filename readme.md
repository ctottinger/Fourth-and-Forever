# Entry Fee
League fees will be $50 for the 2025-2026 season with the intention of increasing next year. This season, all competing teams must buy in before the chosen initial draft, any team not bought in will be removed from the league. Future years fees will be non-refundable in the interest of competition.

___

# Teams
The intention is to have 12 franchises, but as each year may be variable the structure will change. Franchises competing this season:
- New England Flaccid Balls(Tanner Ottinger)

___

# Roster
Each team will have a maximum of 16 active players. Teams shall have no more than 3 quarterbacks, but there will be no other restrictions. 2 IR slots will be available, but managers will be required to monitor their players status and activate when necessary within a timely fashion to ensure the IR slots aren't used as extra active player storage.

___

# Starting Lineup
Players will be locked at their respective game times. Each week managers shall start the following:
- 1 QB
- 2 RBs
- 2 WRs
- 1 TE
- 2 FLEXs
- 1 Defense/Special Teams
- 1 Kicker

*I've decided to force managers to start and keep a full roster, to prevent a team that's ahead from benching their remaining players. I've seen debates about this and understand both sides but I think this will help both avoid drama and make games more competitive - let me know your thoughts if you disagree.*

___

# Scoring
See scoring settings within Sleeper.

___

# Schedule & Divisions
Franchises will be split into two conferences with two divisions, which will be filled randomly with 3 teams each(franchise count allowing). 

- North Conference
    - East Division
    - West Division
- South Conference
    - East Division
    - West Division

Each franchise will play 14 regular season games as follows:

| # of games | Opponent                                                   | Total Games |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 2          | Each divisional opponent                                   | 6           |
| 1          | In conference rival game(randomly picked if no rival exist | 1           |
| 1          | Out of conference rival game(same as above)                | 1           |
| 1          | Each remaining conference opponent                         | 3           |
| 1          | Against 3 random out of conference opponents               | 3           |
| -          | -                                                          | 14          |

___

# Playoffs
I've decided on a 6 team playoff that will be better suited for more franchises joining. 
- Both conference leaders will occupy seeds 1 and 2, seeded based on conference record then [Standard Ranking Tiebreaker](#Standard Ranking Tiebreaker).
- Both remaining division leaders will occupy seeds 3 and 4, seeded based on conference record then [Standard Ranking Tiebreaker](#Standard Ranking Tiebreaker).
- Seed 5 and 6 will be occupied by the two at-large teams for each conference, seeded based on *overall* record then [Standard Ranking Tiebreaker](#Standard Ranking Tiebreaker).

Conference leaders will be awarded a bye week. The first week of playoffs(Week 15) will be as follows:

| Home                        | vs. | Away                        |
| --------------------------- | --- | --------------------------- |
| #1(Higher conference champ) |     | Bye                         |
| #2(Lower conference champ)  |     | Bye                         |
| #3(Higher ranked div champ) |     | #6(Lower ranked at-large)   |
| #4(Lower ranked div champ   |     | #5(Higher ranked at-large)  |

The second week(week 16) of playoffs:

| Home    | vs. | Away                |
| ------- | --- | ------------------- |
| #1 seed |     | Winner of #4 vs. #5 |
| #2 seed |     | Winner of #3 vs. #6 |

The championship will be played in week 17 with the two remaining teams.

*Will likely be a standard 4-team bracket if fewer than 12 franchises participates.*

___

# Losers Bracket

Losers bracket will be same as the playoff bracket, with the 7th through 12th seeds. Instead of seeding based on conference or division standing, the losers bracket will only be seeded based on overall ranking via the [Standard Ranking Tiebreaker](#standard-ranking-tiebreaker). The final winner will get the following 1.01 rookie draft pick, with the rest being inverse of their final rankings.

*This may need to be revisited.*

___

# Standard Ranking Tiebreaker
Ranking ties shall be decided based on the following, in order:
- Overall Win/Loss record
- Head-to-Head record
- Divisional Win/Loss record
- Conference Win/Loss record
- Total Points For.

___

# Waivers
Blind bidding waivers will run year-round with separate in-season and off-season Free Agent Acquisition Budget(FAAB). From the start of preseason, to the first Wednesday after the Super Bowl(note: not the fantasy championship), each franchise will have $1000 total FAAB to spend bidding on players in the waiver wire.

In-season waivers will run Sunday, Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 11:00am *EST*.

During the off-season(Beginning the first Wednesday after the SB), all franchises will be reset to $200 of FAAB and waivers will only process once a week on Wednesdays at 11:00am *EST*.

In the event that two franchises submit an equal bid on a free agent, the team which submitted their bid first will win the tie. 

___

# Trades
Managers may trade players or draft picks at any time of year except during playoffs. Trading is blocked starting Wednesday at 11:00am *EST* before week 14 up until Tuesday at 11:00am *EST* after the conclusion of week 16.

Trades will process immediately upon acceptance. Except in the case of collusion, all trades are final, no takebacksies. Players outplaying or underplaying projections is not a valid reason to undo a trade, nor is being finessed. 

If trading collusion is suspected, please report it to the commissioner. The commissioner will investigate trades and apply actions as necessary. 

Trades involving future draft picks shall not be permitted unless the dues for the seasons in question have been paid in advance by both franchises.

If a trade was offered or accepted in error, the manager making the error must notify the commissioner and the manager of the other team immediately (i.e. within 5 minutes of the trade's acceptance) to request that the trade be voided. Trades will only be revoked because of legitimate manager error that is reported in a timely manner; managers may not request that a trade be voided due to buyer’s remorse, seller’s remorse or failure to perform due diligence before proposing or accepting a trade. The Commissioner reserves the right to allow a trade to stand if a manager's claim of error is not deemed to be credible.

___

# Payouts
The final structure is subject to change based on participants. Basically 3&4 get their fee back, 2 gets double their fee and the champ gets $400.

| Final Standing | Payout |
| -------------- | ------ |
| 1              | $400   |
| 2              | $100   |
| 3              | $50    |
| 4              | $50    |
| 5              | $0     |
| 6              | $0     |
| 7              | $0     |
| 8              | $0     |
| 9              | $0     |
| 10             | $0     |
| 11             | $0     |
| 12             | $0     |
| \-             | $600   |

___

# Initial Draft
This will only be required for the first season. The initial draft will operate just like a normal fantasy draft would, with a random linear draft order. This will take place before the NFL draft at latest(*hopefully*)

___

# Annual Rookie Draft
The rookie draft occur every year after the NFL draft. Teams will have draft positions according to their finishing positions from the previous year in the future, but for the first year the rookie draft will be inverse order from the initial draft.

___

# Rule Changes
The guidelines for rule changes are split into In Season, and Out of Season, based on wether they change the competitive balance of the league. An In Season rule change may be an unforeseen situation or consequence of a rule that should be changed, in order to keep things fair for all franchises. This could be a scoring settings change, or a waiver issue, or really anything that fucks over an undeserving minority of the league. An Out of Season rule change are bigger rule changes such as roster size expansion or playoff seed changes.
## In Season rule changes
All In Season rule changes are at the discretion of the Commissioner. If you feel that an immediate rule change is in order, please contact the Commissioner promptly and explain your reasoning. If a rule change is required immediately/retroactively, then it may be done as such, but for any rule changes brought up during the season a 1 week waiting period *may* be used to ensure that nobody is able to gain an advantage using a rule change. These will be judged on a case-by-case basis, and league input may be called for.
## Out of Season rule changes
Out of Season rule changes will be held to a league vote and must achieve a 2/3 vote to be successful. These changes must be presented to the Commissioner to be held for an official vote. These changes may have to be made over longer time periods, and how these are implemented is ultimately up to the Commissioner. All valid rule changes within reason are acceptable to be voted on, so as long as a rule change is successfully voted for then it shall be done; exact implementation is up to the Commissioner. 

___

# Orphan Teams
Franchise owners can retire from the league in good standing as long as their announce their retirement prior to the end of week 17. Upon announcement of a manager’s retirement, a replacement owner will be sought and they will be responsible for the upcoming season’s league fee if it has not already been paid by the retiring manager. Once an owner announces their retirement, they may not make any trades for the remainder of the season. A retirement announcement is irrevocable, but a manager who retires in good standing may be considered for reinstatement.

Aside from retirement, orphan teams can be created through the following circumstances:

- Quitting manager: 
If an owner publicly declares they are quitting the league, the team is immediately classified as an orphan team and the Commissioner will assume control of the team until a replacement owner is found. Public, written "I quit" declarations are permanent and irrevocable; quitting managers are permanently barred from seeking reinstatement to the league.

- Abandoning manager:
A team is considered abandoned during the season if a manager fails to set a lineup for 2 consecutive games and a team is considered abandoned during the offseason if the manager fails to attend the rookie draft.

- Removal of a manager or managers for: 
    - Failure to pay league fees by the annual deadline.
    - Cheating or anti-competitive conduct.
    - Collusion between teams.
    - Offering and/or accepting bribes (i.e. real-life money or any other real-life consideration) as an incentive to complete league trades, league transactions or influence league activity of any kind.
    - Conduct or transactions detrimental to the league.
    - Repeated failure to adhere to league rules or abide by Commissioner rulings.

If a team is orphaned during the season, the Commissioner will set that team’s starting lineup for the remainder of that season or appoint another manager to set the orphan team’s roster for the remainder of the season, until a new manager is found.

Payouts won by a team orphaned during a regular season will be applied against future league fees for that team’s new manager. If the payout exceeds the annual league fees then the remainder will apply to the league payouts for the following year based on Commissioner discretion. 

Orphaned teams may not participate in the Championship playoff bracket. The next best alternative team will be chosen based on the [Standard Ranking Tiebreaker](#standard-ranking-tiebreaker).

___

# Anticompetitive Conduct
Anticompetitive conduct is defined as owners engaging in conduct that prevents, reduces or otherwise negatively affects the natural competition and well-being of the league. Anticompetitive actions are strictly prohibited, and violations of these rules shall subject an owner to Commissioner's sanctions, which may include immediate removal from the league.
- **Anticompetitive Trades**: owners may not make trades that result in worsening their own team in order to stock another team playing a third team they want or need to lose. Owners may trade away players for draft picks, but they may not make trades if they do not intend to return to the league for the next season. If an owner does not intend to return to the league, they should announce their retirement publicly and play out the season using their best efforts; the incoming replacement owner should be permitted to inherit an intact team and make their own trades and roster decisions. The Commissioner may retroactively void a trade if there is clear and convincing evidence that the trade was prohibited on anti-competitive grounds that were not apparent at the time of the trade.
