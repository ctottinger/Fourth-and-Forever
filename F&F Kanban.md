## Frontburner

- [ ] Finalize Ruleset
	- [ ] Determine all dates(at least a ballpark for dates not set in stone)
	- [x] Finalize season scheduling
	- [x] Finalize roster size, do the math to make sure the waivers aren't too deep
	- [x] Possibly make graphic to visualize the important dates section, it's kinda hard to understand when everything actually is in a table format
- [ ] Send Invitations
	- [ ] Josh Mitchell(Unofficially agreed)
	- [ ] Alec(Unofficially agreed)
	- [ ] Cyrus
	- [ ] Roe
	- [ ] Josh Hannah
	- [ ] JB?
	- [ ] Any other of Josh's groomsman?
	- [ ] Ryan/Dylan/Carson?


## Middleburner

- [ ] Finalize the Discord
	- [ ] Decide on a polling method
		The default Discord polls are nicer, but a little less flexible than the plugin. The plugin also has the ability to hide results until the poll is finalized
	- [ ] Decide if there should be an anonymous board. This can also be decided later, and possibly activated after drafting.
- [ ] Make a draft info document
	This should be a subjective informative document of general helpful info about the draft. This should be written after the rules have been finalized and reflect the them. For instance, if there's a SuperFlex then it should clarify that getting good QB's should be a priority.
