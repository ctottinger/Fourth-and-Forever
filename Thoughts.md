The rookie draft should only be for rookies just drafted, shall rookies be unsignable in waivers? Should the waivers be shut down in the off season between the NFL draft and the rookie draft? Maybe the rookie draft should be immediately after the NFL draft?

Rule change structure may need to be changed.

Deadline for entry fee? Date for initial draft? Annual date for rookie draft?

Summary section for important dates and rules rundown in the top of the rules 

Flesh out manager expectations section to make sure team participate

Increase roster size! Also account for a larger roster for the rookie draft that will shrink back down for the regular season

Make 4-6 IR slots? Only true IR tagged players should be eligible for these. 

Should there be a super flex qb available slot? Maybe it can be made instead of kickers, as theyâ€™re the dumbest fantasy position. 

What about 3 WR slots?

320-350 player slots should be made available, so however many rosters slots teams get should add up in that range

Should one giant startup draft take place after the NFL draft? Would make it easier. Could be 12 hours per pick and teams would have a chance to trade picks and such. 

Should draft picks be picked on inverse points for? Would prevent dumb tanking. 

Top 4 championship teams will be seeded in the next draft 12-8 based inversely on where they finished. i.e, #1 gets the 1.12 pick, #4 gets the 1.08 pick.

All other picks be seeded based on lowest potential points(best starting roster) for the regular season?

FAAB should be tradeable.

Should draft picks farther than two seasons out be untradeable? Probably.
